                    <p class="about-text">
                        We want to encourage our teachers, the families of our children, and the community at large to develop in all areas – academic, cultural and economic – outside of our classroom walls.
                        Here are some ways that Village Community Schools is ensuring practical and sustainable opportunities for helping the members of our community to prosper:

                    <h4><b>Curriculum</b></h4>
                    We provide a classroom environment that encourages children to develop in all areas including academic, social, emotional and physical. We have classes in art, science, math, language, music and gym. Technology is integrated into the curriculum, and we provide access to resources for teachers and students.

                <h4><b>Nutrition Programme</b></h4>
                This daily program includes breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch and an end of day protein snack. Many students do not have access to enough nutritious food at home, and the food provided by GPS has resulted in better health among the children

                </p>

                <p class="about-text">
                <h4><b>Supporting Families</b></h4>
                Many members of the community are involved in the daily operations of the school and the support of its students. Mothers, grandmothers, fathers and other family members are hired by the school to support with lunch and snack times, maintenance, security, and other roles. We understand the importance of supporting the full community and families of our students, and this will continue to be an ongoing mandate of our school.
